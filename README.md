## Hi there 👋
My name is Josh! Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

As I have just finished my time studying at Dev Academy Aotearoa, I've got some awesome stuff to share with you!

During my time at Dev Academy Aotearoa, I developed a strong foundation in web development, learning and applying technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and TypeScript. Through hands-on learning, I gained valuable experience in both frontend and backend development, building dynamic and interactive applications.

Throughout my journey, I worked on various projects that challenged me to solve real-world problems, including a full-stack travel itinerary app and more. These projects not only improved my technical skills but also taught me collaboration, problem-solving, and how to bring ideas to life through code.
